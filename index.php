			<p>
				uniClue is a free, easy to use treasure hunt app that was created through the collaberation of computer science students at Newcastle University. Once given
				a specific and unique HuntID, the app will send users to different locations that contain a QR code that they must scan, by giving them a clue that 
				they must work out as to where the location is,repeating the process until the final location, or the 'treasure', has been reached. However, the treasure hunts 
				that users are sent on are not hunts that are created by the developers, they are hunts that are created by the users themselves! On the uniClue website 
				you can create your own personal hunts thatwill generate a unique hunt ID that you can then send to whoever you want to take part in the hunt.
				</p>
				<p>
				uniClue rises above its competitors by giving the users a simple and easy to use interface that anyone of all ages can use. It provides a fun experience for users
				to take part in, teachers can send their pupils on educational treasure hunts on a school trip, Lecturers can send new students on a hunt around 
				the university campus so they can familiarise themselves with the area, or parents can even send their children on an easter egg hunt in the back garden!
